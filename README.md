# Colin Hicks | Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio contains four projects displaying my abilities in R, Python, SQL and  Tableau. I also contain skills in Excel and am proficient in design tools from the Adobe Creative Cloud. I'm currently looking for employment to further my skills in the Data Science feild.

### [Predictive Modeling in R](https://github.com/colinjhicks/water_potability_prediction)

#### Summary

Implementation of predictive models to determine if the sample tested from a body of water is fit for human consumption. This project includes exploratory analysis, data cleaning, preprocessing, and execution of KNN and Random Forest models for comparison.

###### [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability)

* exploratory analysis
  * box plots
  * correlation matrix
  * distribution plots 
* preprocessing
  * outlier correction
  * partition the data into train and test
  * normalize train and test sets
* run predictive models
  * knn
  * random forest
  * observe confusion matrix for each model
  * observe feature importance for each model

### [Data Analysis in Python](https://github.com/colinjhicks/fitbit_data_analysis)

#### Summary

Exploratory analysis on multiple related datasets that include samples of wearable health data a Fitbit device. This project includes cleaning and various visuals such as a correlation matrix and regression plots.

###### [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit)

* format datetime columns
* summarize each dataset 
* merge datasets
* correlation matrix for merged dataset
* regression plots
* time series bar graph


### [Data Cleaning in SQL](https://github.com/colinjhicks/craigslist_data_exploration)

#### Summary

Using MySQL queries to clean and explore a Kaggle dataset that was created by scraping vehicle postings from Craigslist over a month period. This project includes views for later visualization in Tableau Public.

###### [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data)

* observe data
* concat columns
* replace characters in strings
* delete duplicate values
* create views

### [Visualization in Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/colin.hicks)

#### Summary

This is an extension of my 'Data Cleaning in SQL' project where I use Tableau Public to visualize a number of views over four dashboards. This will link to my Tableau profile where I have saved the dashboards related to the project.

###### [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data)

* geographical heat map
* bar graphs for value counts and averages
* time series line graphs
