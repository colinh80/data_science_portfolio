# Colin Hicks | Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio contains four projects displaying my abilities in R, Python, SQL and  Tableau. I also contain skills in Excel and am proficient in design tools from the Adobe Creative Cloud. I'm currently looking for employment to further my skills in the Data Science feild.

### [Predictive Modeling in R](https://github.com/colinjhicks/water_potability_classification)

###### [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability)

#### Summary

Implementation of predictive models to determine if the sample tested from a body of water is fit for human consumption. This project includes exploratory analysis, data cleaning, preprocessing, and execution of KNN and Random Forest models for comparison.

*	Explore data using label counts, box plots, correlation matrices and density plots
*	Remove outliers using interquartile range and observe variable skew
*	Partition data then normalize the train and test sets independently
*	Implement KNN and RF Models, observe accuracy and feature importance for each model
*	Markdown with explanation of insights and ways to improve accuracy and specificity

### [Data Analysis in Python](https://github.com/colinjhicks/fitbit_data_analysis)

###### [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit)

#### Summary

Exploratory analysis on multiple related datasets that include samples of wearable health data a Fitbit device. This project includes cleaning and various visuals such as a correlation matrix and regression plots.

*	Clean data by formating datetime columns for use of merging
*	Summarize each dataset to observe interesting values for further exploration
*	Correlate date through matrix and heat map, sort correlations in order of significance
*	Observe regression plots based on insights from the correlation matrix
*	Visualize a time series bar chart and summarize concluding thoughts on the data
*	Markdown with explanation of the process and insights for future recomendations


### [Data Cleaning in SQL](https://github.com/colinjhicks/craigslist_data_exploration)

###### [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data)

#### Summary

Using MySQL queries to clean and explore a Kaggle dataset that was created by scraping vehicle postings from Craigslist over a month period. This project includes views for later visualization in Tableau Public.

* Explore and observe possibilities of the data
*	Format columns through the use of concat, creating substrings, replacing characters
*	Find and delete duplicate values with partition, filter outliers
*	Pivot rows to extract data based on specific categories in the data
*	Create views for Tableau visualization based on averages, value counts, and deviations 


### [Visualization in Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/colin.hicks)

###### [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data)

#### Summary

This is an extension of my 'Data Cleaning in SQL' project where I use Tableau Public to visualize a number of views over four dashboards. This will link to my Tableau profile where I have saved the dashboards related to the project.

* geographical heat map
* correlation plots
* bar graphs for value counts, averages, deviations
* time series line graphs
